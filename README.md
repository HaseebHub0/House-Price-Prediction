# House Price Prediction  

A machine learning project to predict house prices using regression models. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using various regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to build a predictive model for house prices based on real estate features such as living area, number of bedrooms, and location.  

## **Technologies Used:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- GitHub for code management  
- Streamlit for app deployment (future).
